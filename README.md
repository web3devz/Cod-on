## **Core Features**

### **AI-Assisted Contract Creation**  
Our platform uses generative AI to simplify and automate the smart contract creation process:  
- Start with an **Initial Idea**: Describe your contract in plain language.  
- Use **Add or Fix Something**: Refine your input, resolve issues, or make enhancements.  
- Click **Abra-Kadabra**: The AI generates a production-ready smart contract, ensuring accuracy and compliance with blockchain standards.  

### **Smart Contract Section**  
- **Generated Contract**: View the smart contract code with syntax highlighting for readability.  
- **AI-Generated Summary**: Understand the purpose and functions of your contract in simple terms.  
- **Copy Smart Contract**: Easily copy the generated code for further customization or external use.  

### **1-Click Deploy**  
Deploy your smart contract directly to the Aeternity testnet without complex configurations. Test your application immediately and iterate with ease.  


## **How It Works**

### **Step 1: Start with an Idea**  
Input your concept in plain language. For example:  
*"I want a smart contract that tracks payments and releases funds when a milestone is met."*

### **Step 2: Generate or Fix**  
Click **Abra-Kadabra** to:  
- Automatically generate a smart contract based on your description.  
- Fix errors, enhance logic, or adapt functionality with AI suggestions.  

### **Step 3: Review and Understand**  
- Check the generated code and review the **AI-generated summary** to ensure it matches your expectations.  

### **Step 4: Deploy Instantly**  
With **1-Click Deploy**, launch your contract to the testnet and start testing your decentralized application.
